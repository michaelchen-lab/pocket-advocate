# Pocket Advocate
###### Michael, Anastasia, William and Zachs @ IvyHacks 2020

Pocket Advocate is a healthcare web app which aims to allow the general public to advocate for better medication and easier health insurance claims.

## The Problem

Healthcare in the US is a nightmare. Insurance companies fight against prescription of better, but more expensive drugs to decrease expenses. Medical professionals' inability to keep up with the huge volume of medical literature leads to prescription of less suitable drugs. These problems persist at an expense of our nation's healthcare.

## Our Solution

1. Pocket Advocate will recommend medication to users based on their diagnosis, medical profile and symptom history. This recommendation engine is trained on large bodies of medical literature using modern NLP and AI techniques. Patients can use this app to advocate for possibly more suitable medications to their doctors.

2. Pocket Advocate allows users to create a medical profile and log their symptoms. This data can be transferred to the relevant health insurance companies to justify the use of relatively expensive, but more suitable drugs.
